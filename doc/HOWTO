This is the HOWTO file.
This file describes how to create an API using the framework.

Before we start creating files, let's understand the contents of it.

- Resources
    Resources are created by the schema and options definitions.
    Schema is the data skeleton that represents the resource with its relations
    Options allows to pass parameters to the server and configure the schema.
    Resource files are stored under usr/api/resource/

- Models
    Models are created by the definition of the model, dependency, validation
    and the find_ and save_ methods for relations (find_relation, save_relation).
    Definition of the model is the field to datatype map and the relationships.
    Dependencies are models used during find_ and save_ queries for relations.
    Validation is the list of fields and relations required for saving.
    find_ methods are how to retrieve relationships to compose complex resources.
    save_ methods are how to save multiple related objects at once.
    Model files are stored under usr/api/model/
    
- DAOs
    DAOs are created by the definition of queries, specially read queries that
    are always complex with filters and joins and groups and sorts and limits.
    The definition of query is a select query created specifically for this 
    resource. Of cource the simple_dao can be used if the entity is simple.
    DAO files are stored under usr/api/dao/

- Request configuration
    The request configuration is composed by multiple entries one per resource.
    The resource can only be accessed after adding it to the configuration file
    until then it will return 404.
    Request configuration is stored under etc/request.ini file and this location 
    can be changed in the etc/api.ini file.
